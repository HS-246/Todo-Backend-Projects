This is my first project made specifically to learn how backend programming and node.js works.

It is a basic todo list tracker that has functionalities such as login, signup, database connectivity, auto refresh etc.
The project makes use of the Sequelize library to manage a PostgreSQL database.
It uses Express.js for routing, Jest for unit tests and EJS templating for frontend design.
The Website has a primitive and minimalistice front end since that was not the focus but thanks to EJS I can use JS scripting inside HTML code to make the process much easier.

Below are Screenshots of parts of this project.
